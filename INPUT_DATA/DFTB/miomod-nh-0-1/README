short description
NHmod for stronger NH binding
        

detailed description:

In previous studies [JACS04,TCA06] consistent errors of about
10 kcal/mol were found specifically for proton affinities of sp3
hybridized nitrogen atoms. Therefore, a modified parameter set
“NHmod” was introduced in which the N-H repulsive potential
was shifted to correct for these errors. However, since sp2
hybridized nitrogen atoms seem to be described correctly, this
correction has only to be applied for a certain electronic
configuration of N. Therefore, similar to the situation in force
fields, different “atom types” for N have to be introduced at the
moment, which clearly limits DFTB’s applicability since these
atom types are not allowed to change during a reaction.
For benchmarks see [JPCA07,JCTC11].
Geometrical properties are very similar to the original mio N-H parameter set.
