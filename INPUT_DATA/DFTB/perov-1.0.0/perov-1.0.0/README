General information
===================

This set was designed to describe the electronic structure of 2D and 3D metal
halide perovskites. The parameters of H, C, and N may slightly deviate from mio-1-1.
We refer to the detailed documentation in the Slater-Koster files for further
information. The compression radii of Cs have been taken from Ref.[JCTC13], the
power of the confinement potential, however, is slightly different.

Note: This set assumes that you use shell-resolved SCC in DFTB. In case you use
the DFTB+ code, you can achieve it by setting `OrbitalResolvedSCC = Yes`.


Maximal angular momenta
-----------------------
H: s
C: p
N: p
I: p
Cs: s
Pb: p


Spin constants
--------------

Note, the calculation of the spin constants follows here for all elements the
convention as used for the Hubbard U values: For non-occupied atomic orbitals
(orbitals above HOMO), the corresponding value of the HOMO is used.

H:
     -0.07174
C:
     -0.03062     -0.02505
     -0.02505     -0.02265
N:
     -0.03318     -0.02755
     -0.02755     -0.02545
Cs:
     -0.00949
I:
     -0.01445     -0.01132
     -0.01132     -0.01145
Pb:
     -0.01335     -0.00932
     -0.00932     -0.01097


Repulsive energy:
========================================

NOTABENE: NO REPULSIVE potential is provided; there is a dummy spline only.
          The SKFs CANNOT be used to do structural relaxation.
