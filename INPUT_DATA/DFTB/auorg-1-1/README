General information
===================

This set was designed to describe the optical excitations of thiolates on gold
nanoclusters. It is an extension of the mio-1-1 set with Au.

Note: This set assumes that you use shell resolved SCC in DFTB. In case you use
the DFTB+ code, you can achieve it by setting `OrbitalResolvedSCC = Yes`.


Maximal angular momenta
-----------------------
C: p
H: s
N: p
O: p
S: d
Au: d


Spin constants
--------------

Note, the calculation of the spin constants follows here for all elements the
convention as used for the Hubbard U values: For non-occupied atomic orbitals
(orbitals above HOMO) the corresponding value of the HOMO is used.
