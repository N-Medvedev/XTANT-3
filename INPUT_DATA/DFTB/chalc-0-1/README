This special parametrization was used to investigate defects in chlacogenide
glasses (amorphous As2S3) and extends the earlier parametrization of the As-S-H 
hyb-0-1 set by using d-orbitals on As. This was necessary in order to get a 
qualitative correct picture for overcoordinated As defects in these systems.

Warning: This set was not optimized for the calculation of reaction and binding
energies. It delivers correct electronics and geometries and can be used for
TD-DFTB calculaions. A general validation wrt to molecules/surfaces/bulk was
_not_ performed.

Requires the mio-0-1 set
