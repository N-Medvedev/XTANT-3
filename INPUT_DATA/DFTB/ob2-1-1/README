Description
===========

This set of parameters is part of the Parametrization for Organic and Biological
Molecules (OB2) has been specifically designed for Long-range Corrected Density
Functional Tight Binding (LC-DFTB2).  Comprehensive benchmark tests for C-H-N-O
can be found in J. Chem. Theory Comput., 2018, 14 (1), pp 115–12. Please also
consult the paper for the details and use cases of the various sets (base,
shift, split).

The elements should be used with following maximal angular momenta:

H:s, C: p, N: p, O: p
