*************************************************************
It is a hybrid code aimed at modeling femtosecond X-ray-induced effects in matter. The code combines the following methods into one model with feed-backs:
 a) Monte Carlo (MC) method for modeling X-ray-induced electron kinetics
 b) tight binding molecular dynamics (TBMD) for tracing atomic responce to modification of the interatomic potential due to electronic excitation
 c) Boltzmann collision integrals (BCI):
 - relaxation-time approximation for electron-electron scattering
 - dynamical coupling for nonadiabatic electron-ion (electron-phonon) coupling
 d) random phase approximation (RPA) for calculation of the optical properties of the material

In a publication, at least the following parameters should be mentioned for reproducibility of the results: Material, its initial structure, the number of atoms in the supercell, the initial conditions (atomic and electronic temperatures), an ensemble used, a type of boundary conditions, a scheme of low-energy electron thermalization (and value of thermalization type is nonequilibrium scheme is used), a type of cross sections in Monte Carlo simulation, a type of tight binding parametrization, whether the electron emission was included or not (if yes, whether Coulomb potential for atoms was accounted for and what model for electron emission was used), whether an additional short-range repulsive potential was used (and what type), time step of MD simulation, parameters of the incoming laser pulse (its photon energy, deposited dose, duration).
