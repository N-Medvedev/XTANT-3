*******************************************************
The following flags are supported in XTANT:

1) Help -- this very help output
2) Info -- basic information about XTANT
3) Size -- conmputes cohesive energy of the material as a function of the nearest neighbour distance
4) Allow_rotation -- run MD simulation without removing total angular momentum
5) Verbose -- prints out a lot of extra information useful for debugging

*******************************************************
The list of known errors (to check in the file OUTPUT_Error_log.dat if exists):
Error #1: file not found
Error #2: file could not be opened
Error #3: file could not be read on the line number given
Error #4: some problem with databases (EADL, EPDL97, periodic table file, etc.)
Error #5: inconsistent TB parametrization (only the same type of parametrization is allowed for all elements within compound)
Error #6: diagonalization subroutine with LAPACK failed (uses MKL library)
Error #7: some errors in low-energy electrons (probably in tempereature or chem.potential calculation)
Error #8: error in optical coefficients (probably in complex Hamiltonian)

*******************************************************
You can communicate with the program on-the-fly
Type in the file "Communication.txt" (in the OUTPUT folder created) one of the following options:
1) time "number" : to change total duration of the program (give new number in [fs])
2) MDdt "number" : to change time-step of MD (give new number in [fs])
3) SAVEdt "number" : to change how often outputs are saved (give new number in [fs])
