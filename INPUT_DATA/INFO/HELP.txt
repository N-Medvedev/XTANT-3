*************************************************************
The following flags are supported in XTANT:

1) Help -- this very note
2) Info -- basic information about XTANT
3) Size -- computes cohesive energy of the material as a function of the nearest neighbour distance
4) Allow_rotation -- run MD simulation without removing total angular momentum
5) Matter -- prints out list of already available materials
6) Verbose -- prints out a lot of extra information useful for debugging

*************************************************************
The list of known errors (to check in the file OUTPUT_Error_log.dat if exists):
Error #1: file not found
Error #2: file could not be opened
Error #3: file could not be read on the line number given
Error #4: some problem with databases (EADL, EPDL97, periodic table file, etc.)
Error #5: inconsistent TB parametrization (only the same type of parametrization is allowed for all elements within compound)
Error #6: diagonalization subroutine with LAPACK failed (uses MKL library)
Error #7: some errors in low-energy electrons (probably in tempereature or chem.potential calculation)
Error #8: error in optical coefficients (probably in complex Hamiltonian)
Error #9: error in conversion between fluence and dose

You can communicate with the program on-the-fly
Type in the file "Communication.txt" (in the OUTPUT folder created) one of the following options:
1) time "number" : to change the total duration of the simulation (number in [fs])
2) SAVEdt "number" : to change how often outputs are saved (number in [fs]).
3) MDdt "number" : to change the timestep of MD simulation (number in [fs]).
4) OMP "number" : to change the number of OpenMP threads in the parallel calculations (integer). Setting here a zero or negative number will set the number of threads equal to the maximum number of threads on your machine.
5) Thermostat_Ta "number" : to change the temperature of the atomic Berendsen thermostat. The number sets the new atomic temperature in [K]. A negative number switches off the atomic thermostat.
6) Thermostat_dt_a "number" : to change the characteristic time of the atomic Berendsen thermostat. The number sets the new characteristic time of the thermostat in [fs]. A negative number switches off the atomic thermostat.
7) Thermostat_Te "number" : to change the temperature of the electronic Berendsen thermostat. The number sets the new atomic temperature in [K]. The negative number switches off the electronic thermostat.
8) Thermostat_dt_e "number" : to change the characteristic time of the electronic Berendsen thermostat. The number sets the new characteristic time of the thermostat in [fs]. The negative number switches off the electronic thermostat.
9) Verbose : switches the verbose option on.
10) verbose_off : switches the verbose option off.
